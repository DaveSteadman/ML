Hi, how are you doing?
I'm fine. How about yourself?
I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking.
No problem. So how have you been?
I've been great. What about you?
I've been good. I'm in school right now.
Do you like it there?
It's okay. It's a really big campus.
Good luck with school.
Thank you very much.

How's it going?
I'm doing well. How about you?
Never better, thanks.
So how have you been lately?
I've actually been pretty good. You?
I'm actually in school right now.
Which school do you attend?
I'm attending PCC right now.
Are you enjoying it there?
It's not bad. There are a lot of people there.
Good luck with that.
Thanks.

How are you doing today?
I'm doing great. What about you?
I'm absolutely lovely, thank you.
Everything's been good with you?
I haven't been better. How about yourself?
I started school recently.
How do you like it so far?
I like it so far. My classes are pretty good right now.
I wish you luck.
Thanks a lot.

It's an ugly day today.
I know. I think it may rain.
It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
That would be weird.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be.
I really wish it wasn't so hot every day.
Me too. I can't wait until winter.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather be cold than hot.
Me too.

It doesn't look very nice outside today.
You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
That wouldn't seem right.
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.
I know, you're absolutely right.
I wish it would cool off one day.
That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.
I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.
That's exactly how I feel.

I wish it was a nicer day today.
That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be.
I want it to cool down some.
I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
I feel the same way.

It's such a nice day.
Yes, it is.
It looks like it may rain soon.
Yes, and I hope that it does.
Why is that?
I really love how rain clears the air.
Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains.
Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.
Really? Why is it?
Because you can see the stars perfectly.
I really hope it rains today.
Yeah, me too.

Isn't it a nice day?
It really is.
It seems that it may rain today.
Hopefully it will.
How come?
I like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
I feel the same way. It smells so good after it rains.
I especially love the night air when it rains.
Really? Why?
The stars look so much closer after it rains.
I really want it to rain today.
Yeah, so do I.

Don't you think it's nice out?
Yes, I think so too.
I think that it's going to rain.
I hope that it does rain.
You like the rain?
The sky looks so clean after it rains. I love it.
I understand. Rain does make it smell cleaner.
I love most how it is at night after it rains.
How come?
You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
I would love for it to rain today.
I would too.

Hello, may I speak to Alice please?
This is she. How's it going?

No, thanks. I already took some medicine.
I hope you feel better.

Would you like anything for your stomach?
I took something earlier.
Get better.
Thanks a lot.

Why didn't you go to school yesterday?
I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well.
What was your problem?
My stomach was bothering me.
Are you feeling any better?
I'm still feeling a little sick.
I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol?
That's okay.
I hope you feel better.
I'd appreciate that.

I'm sure you have a talent. It's just hidden.

Oh, why is that?

You've seen it before?
Yes, I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters.
Didn't you laugh through the whole movie? I did.

Mine too.
I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it.
Sure, let's go.

I went to see it the day it came out.
I was laughing through the whole movie.
I couldn't help laughing, either.
Same here.
I bought the movie. Would you like to come to my house and watch it?
Of course.

Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite?

You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious.
I didn't know that you saw Superbad before.
I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out.

I would love to.

Did you hear the news?
What happened?
Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.
She did? Why didn't anyone tell me?

No, not recently.
I want to go to see a movie this weekend.
What's stopping you then?
I don't want to go alone.
So, will you be at school tomorrow?

I'm having dinner with my family
Maybe you can come next time.
I'll make sure and come to your next party.
I'll look for you at my next party.
I'll be there.

It was nice talking to you.
Why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
I really have to go.
Why? I still wanted to talk to you.
I have things to do.
Like what?
Don't be nosey.
I'm not. I just want to know.
Well, it's really none of your business.
That's harsh.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
Fine.

I've enjoyed conversing with you.
Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?
I've got to go.
I wasn't done talking to you.
I have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey.
I'm not being nosey. I'm just asking.
I really don't think it's any of your business.
That's not nice.
I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now.
Okay.

I'll talk to you later.
What's the rush?
I have to get off the phone now.
I'm not ready to get off the phone with you.
There are other things I need to take care of.
What is it that you need to do?
Please don't be nosey.
I'm not being nosey, it's just a question.
You don't need to worry about that.
That was mean to say.
I am very sorry, but I must go.
I guess.

Well, it was nice talking to you.
