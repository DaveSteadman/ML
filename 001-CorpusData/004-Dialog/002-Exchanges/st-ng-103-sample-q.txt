SS Tsiolkovsky, repeat your message.
Well hello, Enterprise. Welcome. I hope you have a lot of pretty boys on board.
Do it! Yeah, go ahead. Do it!

Correction, sir, that's blown out.
Apparently some of them were apparently blown out the emergency hatches.
But there were eighty people on that ship, Number One.
