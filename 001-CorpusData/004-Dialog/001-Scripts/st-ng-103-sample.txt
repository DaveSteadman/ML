DATA: SS Tsiolkovsky, repeat your message. 
WOMAN: Well hello, Enterprise. Welcome. I hope you have a lot of pretty boys on board. 
MAN: Do it! Yeah, go ahead. Do it!
DATA: Captain, what we just heard is impossible. 

RIKER: Cover the ship as planned. Move out. 
DATA: Indications of what humans would call a wild party? 
RIKER: Their Bridge. If this thing works, be sure to record everything. 

RIKER: You were right. Somebody blew the hatch. They were all sucked out into space. 
DATA: Correction, sir, that's blown out. 
RIKER: Thank you, Data. 

RIKER: Apparently some of them were apparently blown out the emergency hatches. 
PICARD: But there were eighty people on that ship, Number One. 
RIKER: Yes sir.
