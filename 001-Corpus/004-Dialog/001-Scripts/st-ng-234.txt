PICARD: Computer, stop playback. Change the clarinet to an oboe. Continue recording. 
PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. 
PICARD: Yes, gentlemen? 
LAFORGE: Captain we'd like your permission to take the Engineering computer offline for a couple of hours. We're working on a new interface that would allow Data to act as an emergency backup in the event of a ship-wide systems failure. 
DATA: In theory, my neural network should be able to sustain key systems until primary control is restored. 
PICARD: It sounds like an intriguing experiment. I'll be interested to see the results. Permission granted. 
LAFORGE: It's possible we may even be able to run secondary systems through Data. Weapons control, sensor arrays. 
PICARD: Yes, I get the idea, Mister La Forge. Thank you. Please proceed. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, I need to talk to you about Something for Breakfast. 
PICARD: Breakfast? 
CRUSHER: The play. 
PICARD: Ah, yes. Well, it's a very intriguing drama, but I really don't have the time it would take to learn a part. And anyway, I'm not much of an actor. 
CRUSHER: That's no problem. 
PICARD: Oh? 
CRUSHER: Well, you wouldn't be playing one of the leads. 
PICARD: Oh. 
CRUSHER: It's a very small part. Only two lines. 
PICARD: Really. 
CRUSHER: You play the butler. 
PICARD: Well, I'll think about it and let you know. 
CRUSHER: You would be wonderful, Jean-Luc. We're rehearsing today at one thirty. 
PICARD: Computer, begin playback from the first measure. 
PICARD: Computer, pause recording. Yes? 
WORF: Captain, I am sorry to interrupt. 
PICARD: No, please, Mister Worf, come in. 
WORF: I was hoping to take advantage of the Biko's delay by staging shipwide security drills. I have planned a tentative schedule. 
PICARD: Oh yes, this is very impressive, Mister Worf. But we'll be taking on new personnel at Starbase one eighteen in a few weeks. Surely the drills can wait until then. 
WORF: In that case, I will use the time to perform maintenance checks on the forward phaser array. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, is there some reason why you're trying to give yourself more work? 
WORF: No, sir. I simply wish to use the extra time 
PICARD: Enjoy yourself. You have the free time. Use it. 
WORF: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Computer, continue recording and playback once more. From the top.

ALEXANDER: Father! What did he say? 
WORF: The Captain saw fit to release me from my duties. 
ALEXANDER: You mean you can go? 
WORF: I can go. 
ALEXANDER: Saddle up, Father. 

WORF: Where are we? 
ALEXANDER: Deadwood. Nineteenth century Earth. The Ancient West. 
WORF: What is our function here? 
ALEXANDER: You're the Sheriff and I'm the deputy. 
WORF: So, we are in law enforcement. 
ALEXANDER: Right.

DATA: Geordi, I have noticed that you have not shaved. Are you attempting to grow another beard? 
LAFORGE: As a matter of fact, I am, Data. What do you think? 
DATA: As is the case with many natural growth processes, it is difficult to envision the end product based on an intermediate stage. 
LAFORGE: You're right. Give it a few more days. 
LAFORGE: Okay, I'm going to need to access your auxiliary inputs. 
DATA: One moment. 
LAFORGE: I must admit, Data, I never get used to seeing you like this. 
DATA: I do not understand. You are constantly working on similar electronic systems, yet their appearances do not disturb you. 
LAFORGE: But you're not just another electronic system. 
DATA: Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you just another biological organism. 
LAFORGE: All right, that should do it. Are you ready? 
DATA: Yes. Establishing computer linkup. Interface complete. 
LAFORGE: All right, let's see what you can do.

WORF: You wrote this holodeck programme yourself? 
ALEXANDER: Well, Mister Barclay helped a little. 
WORF: I must have a little talk with Mister Barclay. 

ELI: If I ever find the varmint who drew this, he'll be sorry he ever put pen to paper. I'm ten times uglier than that, ain't I? 
ELI: Shut up. You laugh so much, it's a wonder you ain't got flies in your mouth. 
BANDITO: You're a very funny man, Senor Eli. 
ALEXANDER: That's the bad guy. His name's Eli Hollander. They call him the Butcher of Bozeman. He's killed twenty three men. He's the meanest and the toughest gunslinger in the West. You have to watch him. He's fast. 
WORF: So I am here to apprehend him? 
ALEXANDER: If you can. 
WORF: You are under arrest. 
ELI: Is that so. 
WORF: You will come with me. 
ALEXANDER: No, no, no. Computer, freeze programme. 
WORF: What is wrong? 
ALEXANDER: That was too easy. It has to be harder to beat the bad guys. Otherwise, it's no fun. Computer, increase programme difficulty to level four. Go back to where my father and I first walked into the saloon. Come on, Father. 
ELI: If I ever find the varmint who drew this, he'll be sorry he ever put pen to paper. I'm ten times uglier than that, ain't I? 
ELI: Shut up. You laugh so much, it's a wonder you ain't got flies in your mouth. 
BANDITO: You're a very funny man, Senor Eli. 
WORF: Where are they going? 
ALEXANDER: They don't want to get hit by the bullets. 
WORF: You are under arrest. 
ELI: Well, looks like Sheriff Worf's here to arrest me. That don't sound like a bright idea. 
ELI: Do it? 
WORF: You have been accused of committing a homicide. 
ELI: If you mean murder, then I guess I'm guilty. I've killed twenty three men, Sheriff. One more ain't going to make much of a difference. Of course, shooting someone as ugly as you couldn't be considered a crime, could it? Was you just born that way, or did your momma marry an armadillo? 
ALEXANDER: Sheriff, look out! 
WORF: I'm beginning to see the appeal of this programme. 
ELI: Don't twitch a whisker, Sheriff, unless you want a shave. (his gun is drawn) Okay, boys. Saddle up. But first, get their money and jewellry. 
WORF: You are a murderer and a thief. 
ELI: A man's got to make a living. 
TROI: I suggest you find a new line of work. 
ALEXANDER: I asked Counsellor Troi to join us. She loves Western stories. 
ELI: You'll regret this, stranger. 

DATA: I am now attempting to access the long range sensor array. 
LAFORGE: Forward sensor array coming online. We're getting a clear scan. 
DATA: I will perform a routine maintenance check on the starboard inertial damping system. 
LAFORGE: Dampers online. Maintenance check in progress. Data, I think we're on to something here. Let's see what you can do with secondary systems. Try gravitational control. 
DATA: Initiating gravitational 
LAFORGE: What's wrong? 
DATA: There appears to be an energy fluctuation in my neural net. I am disconnecting my interface to the computer. Interface deactivated. 
LAFORGE: You all right? 
DATA: I have experienced a brief power surge in my positronic subprocessor. But I am fine. 
LAFORGE: Maybe the interface coding isn't as stable than we thought. Looks like we've got a couple of hours of systems analysis before we can try this again. Let's check the interface programming. 

WORF: What are his rights in this century? Is there be a trial or shall I execute him? 
ALEXANDER: We're supposed to hold him until the US Marshal comes, and then we'll take him to Rapid City for a trial. 
ELI: Frankly, I don't think I'll be around here that long. Not after my old man hears about this. 
WORF: What old man are you referring to? 
ELI: My pa. When he breaks me out of this tin can, the gravedigger'll be working overtime. 
ALEXANDER: Your pa's no match for Sheriff Worf. 
WORF: Yes. When your pa comes, we will be ready for him. 
TROI: He's right. You're no match for the Hollanders. 
WORF: I am sure the three of us can handle any problems. 
TROI: Hold on. I was just passing through town, saw a little trouble, thought I'd lend a hand. But I ain't one of your deputies, Sheriff. 
WORF: Counsellor, I would appreciate some support in this matter. 
TROI: Durango. I'm called Durango. 
WORF: Yes, er, Counsellor Durango, perhaps you would consider becoming a temporary deputy? 
TROI: For a price. Five hundred dollars. 
WORF: Alexander we require large amounts of currency. 
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir. I'll go to the bank and make a withdrawal. 
WORF: Deanna, how do you know so much about this period in Earth's history? 
TROI: My father used to read me stories from the Ancient West when I was a little girl. I must admit, I always wanted to play the part of the mysterious stranger. 
ANNIE: You are so brave, facing down that evil man like you did. 
WORF: Why hank you. Miss? 
ANNIE: Annie, you big galoot. You best not forget that tonight, 'cos I'm going to make you beef steak and some gooseberry cobbler for dessert. 
TROI: Sounds delicious. 
ANNIE: And I bought some special candles for the table setting. Pure beeswax. 
WORF: I will not be able to come this evening. I have a prisoner. 
TROI: I'll watch him for you, Sheriff. You two go have a good time. 
WORF: That's very considerate of you, but I would be negligent in my duties if I did not stay. I am sorry, Miss Annie. 
ANNIE: It's another woman, ain't it? It's that floozy down there at Miss Langford's house of pleasure. 
WORF: Who? 
ELI: You sure got a way with women, Sheriff.

PICARD: Computer, activate Picard Mozart trio, programme one. Play back tracks one, two and three. Tempo allegro. 
PICARD: Computer, stop playback. Computer identify musical composition. 
COMPUTER: Picard Mozart trio, programme one.

CRUSHER: Okay, let's work through Act two from the beginning. Whenever you're ready. 
RIKER: Felis catus, is your taxonomic nomenclature. An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature.
CRUSHER: Hold it. Will, what are you reading? 
RIKER: The lines. Why? 
CRUSHER: That's not the right dialogue. 
CRUSHER: Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses contribute to 
RIKER: I recognise it. This is Data's poetry. 
CRUSHER: What? The play's gone. I just keep getting more poetry.

LAFORGE: Well, the PADDs are functioning normally. It seems to be a problem with the information retrieval net. Somehow when you tried to call up your play, the computer accessed Data's literary files. 
DATA: Geordi, perhaps this problem is related to our interface experiment. 
LAFORGE: We'd better run a level two diagnostic on the computer. See if this problem has spread to any other systems. 
DATA: And I will perform a self-diagnostic. 
LAFORGE: That's a good idea. 
CRUSHER: You will let me know if you find the play? 
LAFORGE: Oh yeah, don't worry. It's in here somewhere.

BANDITO: We got him, jefe. 
DATA-FRANK: Where's my boy? 
ALEXANDER: I'm not supposed to be kidnapped now. Computer, freeze programme! Hey, Computer, freeze programme. 
BANDITO: You want us to kill him, Senor Frank? 
DATA-FRANK: No. He's more valuable to us alive.

DATA: Feline supplement one hundred twenty seven. Spot, I have formulated a new mixture of foods specifically designed for your highly selective tastes. 
DATA: I find it extremely difficult to predict what you will find acceptable. Perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again. 
DATA: Spot, you are disrupting my ability to work. 
DATA: Vamoose, you little varmint.

ANNIE: What'll it be? 
WORF: I was looking for my deputy. Perhaps you have seen him. 
ANNIE: Nope. What'll you have? 
WORF: Klingon fire wine. 
ANNIE: This ain't Kansas City. We ain't got none of that fancy European stuff here. Maybe I should get you a sherry. Ain't that is what they serve at Miss Langford's? It is, ain't it? Ain't it? 
DATA-FRANK: Howdy, Sheriff. 
WORF: Commander, what are you doing here? 
DATA-FRANK: The name is Frank Hollander. What are you smiling at? 
WORF: Nothing. Nothing at all, Mister Hollander. What is it you want? 
DATA-FRANK: My boy. 
WORF: That is impossible. Your son is to stand trial for murder. 
DATA-FRANK: Well then, we'll just have to work something out. Is there anything you want in exchange for my boy? 
WORF: You have nothing I want. 
DATA-FRANK: Is that so? Is that so? What about your deputy? 
WORF: What about him? Where is he? I do not negotiate with criminals. Your son will stand trial. 
DATA-FRANK: Not so fast. 
WORF: Commander, what are you doing? 
DATA-FRANK: I ain't in the mood for games, Sheriff. 
WORF: Data? Commander? Computer, freeze programme. 
DATA-FRANK: I wouldn't walk out that door if I was you, Sheriff. 

TROI: What's wrong? 
WORF: The holodeck safeguards are not functioning. Alexander's in trouble. 
TROI: My God, you've been shot! Computer, end programme. Troi to Captain Picard. Troi to Security. 
WORF: There's another character in the programme. Hollander's father. And he looks like Commander Data. 
TROI: Data? 
WORF: But it is not Data. I cannot explain. I believe he has taken Alexander. 
DATA-ELI: Oh, now isn't that a shame? Poor Sheriff's been injured. What's the matter? Was my pa a little too rough on you? 
TROI: Data? 
DATA-ELI: What? 
TROI: Why is the computer creating characters that look like Data? 
WORF: Where have they taken my son? Where is he? 
DATA-ELI: Temper, temper, Sheriff. My pa ain't going to like if I come home all bruised. 
TROI: Worf, wait. We have to remember, even though the holodeck safeguards may be off, this is still a programme. If we can just get to the end of this story the way it was designed to play out, the programme will automatically terminate. 
WORF: You are right. I will begin by speaking to the people of this town. Perhaps someone witnessed Alexander's abduction.

LAFORGE: We think our interface experiment may have caused one of the computer's core subroutines to be altered. 
DATA: When the interface malfunction occurred, subroutine C forty seven was replaced by elements from my personal programming. 
RIKER: What does C forty seven control? 
LAFORGE: Library computer access, replicator selection, recreational programming. No critical systems. 
DATA: That would explain why your music composition programme began playing The Slavonic Dances. I have been analysing the collected works of Antonin Dvorak. 
LAFORGE: It's the same with Doctor Crusher's play, and with the food replicators. 
RIKER: The replicators on decks four through nine are producing nothing but cat food. 
PICARD: Cat food? 
DATA: I have been formulating nutritional supplements for Spot. 
PICARD: When can you correct the problem? 
DATA: We are currently attempting to isolate the corrupt circuit pathways. I reckon the process should take less then two hours. 
PICARD: What did you say? 
DATA: I said the process should take less than two hours. 
RIKER: No, you said I reckon. 
DATA: According to my memory log, I did not use those words. Ya'll must be mistaken. 
LAFORGE: There, Data, you did it again. 
DATA: Did whut? 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, perhaps you should take Mister Data to Engineering. See if you can find the problem. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 

DATA-ELI: Can I help you with somethin? 
WORF: I spoke to several witnesses who saw Alexander being abducted as he was leaving the bank by one of Hollander's men. We must begin a systematic search of the town. 
TROI: Worf, we've got another problem. I saw Eli playing cards. He was shuffling the way Data does when he plays poker. He doesn't just look like Data, he has Data's abilities. Which means his father probably does also. 
DATA-FRANK: I've came to see my boy. 
WORF: Remove your weapon. 
DATA-FRANK: Better take a good look at that gun, Sheriff. You might be seeing it again real soon. 
DATA-ELI: Pa? 
DATA-FRANK: Eli! How are they treating you, boy? 
DATA-ELI: Real bad, pa. They ain't fed me since I got here and the Sheriff's been roughin up on me somethin fierce. 
DATA-FRANK: Don't you worry, boy. The Sheriff's going to pay. Who's the stranger? 
DATA-ELI: Don't know. She ain't said her name. But she's in cahoots with the Sheriff and she's mighty mean with that Winchester. 
DATA-FRANK: You sit tight, boy. I'll have you home in time for supper. I'm going to give you one more opportunity, Sheriff, to avoid a ugly situation. Release my boy. 
WORF: I have reconsidered your offer. I will release your son in exchange for my deputy. 
DATA-FRANK: I thought you might have a change of heart. Meet me in two hours. You be in front of the saloon. I'll be in front of the livery station. Strangers ain't invited. 
WORF: Agreed. 
TROI: In every Western I've ever read, the villains always break their word. he can't be trusted. 
WORF: But we have made an honourable agreement. 
TROI: They're not concerned with honour, Worf. This is the Ancient West. There's a gunfighter out there who has the speed and accuracy of an android. And in two hours, he's going to try to kill you.

RIKER: Mister Data. 
DATA: Howdy, Commander. 
RIKER: Geordi, what have you found? 
DATA: Well, we figure part of my memory structure (normally) was replaced with information from the computer's recreational data base. 
LAFORGE: Specifically, the files relating to the nineteenth century American West. 
RIKER: That would explain the accent. 
DATA: You got it, partner. 
RIKER: This is a result of the experimental interface? 
LAFORGE: I'm afraid so. But we've initiated a progressive memory purge to restore Data's programming to its original state. He should be back to normal in a couple of hours. 
RIKER: And what about the computer's recreational data base? 
LAFORGE: We started a memory purge there as well. It'll take another hour, maybe two. 
DATA: Commander. You just sit tight. We'll have this all fixed up in time for supper. 
RIKER: Good.

WORF: I will be positioned here, at the eastern end of the street. Frank Hollander says he will approach from this end. When he reaches this point, he will be within range. 
TROI: Understood. What about Alexander? 
WORF: There's a rain barrel in front of the saloon. It should be enough to stop the bullets. 
ANNIE: You would not believe what I went through to get old man Newsom to give up his telegraph machine. 
WORF: Excellent. 
ANNIE: Lord knows why I keep risking my life for you, Sheriff. 
WORF: Oh, yes. Thank you, Miss Annie. I am in your debt. 
WORF: I have connected the communicator's energy cell to serve as the power source. 
TROI: How long will the field last? 
WORF: No more than fifteen seconds. It is highly unstable. 
TROI: Let's hope it's enough.

DATA-FRANK: Eli, get down! 
WORF: Alexander! 
TROI: Don't even think about it. 
DATA-MEXICAN: Senor Frank! 
DATA-FRANK: Go ahead. Shoot me. 
WORF: Do not show your face in this town again. 
DATA-FRANK: Let's go.

ALEXANDER: Father! 
WORF: Are you all right? 
ALEXANDER: Yes. 
WORF: End programme. 
TROI: I don't understand this. The story should be over. What's left? 
WORF: Computer, end programme. 
DATA-ANNIE: Sheriff! You're as handy with a shooting iron as you are with a woman's heart. 
WORF: Computer, end programme! Computer! Now! 

ALEXANDER: Father? After what happened I guess you'll never want to go back to the Ancient West. 
WORF: The town of Deadwood may face danger once again. If they do, they will need a Sheriff and a deputy.
